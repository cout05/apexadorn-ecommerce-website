#ApexAdorn clothing store

Made using Vite+React, Tailwind css and Fakestoreapi.

I learned a lot in this project, this is my first project using tailwind, I also learn how to use UseContext while creating this project, it was fun and frustrating at the same time, at first I struggle to pass some props but then I discover that I can use Usecontext hook to do that and it makes my code less complicated.
